// Lena is preparing for an important coding competition that is preceded by a number of sequential preliminary contests.
// Initially, her luck balance is 0. She believes in "saving luck", and wants to check her theory.Each contest is described by two integers, L[i] and T[i]:

// L[i] is the amount of luck associated with a contest. If Lena wins the contest, her luck balance will decrease by L[i]; if she loses it, her luck balance will increase by L[i].
// T[i] denotes the contest's importance rating. It's equal to 1 if the contest is important, and it's equal to 0 if it's unimportant.

// If Lena loses no more than k important contests, what is the maximum amount of luck she can have after competing in all the preliminary contests? This value may be negative.

// Example
// k = 2;
// L = [5, 1, 4];
// T = [1, 1, 0];

// Contest	L[i]	T[i]
// 1		5	    1
// 2		1	    1
// 3		4	    0

// If Lena loses all of the contests, her will be 5 + 1 + 4 = 10.
// Since she is allowed to lose 2 important contests, and there are only 2 important contests, she can lose all three contests to maximize her luck at 10.

// If k = 1, she has to win at least 1 of the 2 important contests. She would choose to win the lowest value important contest worth 1. Her final luck will be 5 + 4 - 1 = 8.

// Function Description

// Complete the luckBalance function in the editor below.
// luckBalance has the following parameter(s):

// int k: the number of important contests Lena can lose
// int contests[n][2]: a 2D array of integers where each contests[i] contains two integers that represent the luck balance and importance of the "ith" contest

// Returns
// int: the maximum luck balance achievable

// Input Format

// The first line contains two space-separated integers n and ,k the number of preliminary contests and the maximum number of important contests Lena can lose.
// Each of the next n lines contains two space-separated integers, L[i] and T[i], the contest's luck balance and its importance rating.

// Constraints
// 1 <= n <= 100
// 0 <= k <= N
// 1 <= L[i] <= 10 ^ 4
// T[i] Îµ { 0, 1 }

// Sample Input

// STDIN       Function
// -----       --------
// 6 3         n = 6, k = 3
// 5 1         contests = [[5, 1], [2, 1], [1, 1], [8, 1], [10, 0], [5, 0]]
// 2 1
// 1 1
// 8 1
// 10 0
// 5 0

// Sample Output
// 29

// Explanation

// There are n = 6 contests. Of these contests, 4 are important and she cannot lose more than 3 of them. Lena maximizes her luck if she wins the 3rd important contest (where L[i] = 1) and loses all of the other five contests for a total luck balance of 5 + 2 + 8 + 10 + 5 - 1 = 29.
